# Data-Visualization-on-Heart-Disease-Dataset
We will be closely working on the prediction of heart disease, and for that, we will be examining the heart disease dataset. From that dataset, we will derive various insights that help us know the weightage of each feature and how they are interrelated to one another, but this time, our only goal is to identify the likelihood that a person will be affected by a coronary artery problem or not.

The Heart Disease prediction will have the following key takeaways:

Data insight: As mentioned here we will be working with the heart disease detection dataset and we will be putting out interesting inferences from the data to derive some meaningful results.
EDA: Exploratory data analysis is the key step for getting meaningful results.
Feature engineering: After getting the insights from the data we have to alter the features so that they can move forward for the model building phase.
Model building: In this phase, we will be building our Machine learning model for heart disease detection.
